# Hydrogen
Hydrogen is a work-in-progress scripting language based off the script Skydrogen.
Hydrogen will offer faster scripts and more control as well as new effects and events.
The placeholders will be remade to use %player% and use different seperately created expressions
and an addon API to register new addons with ease.
